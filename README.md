# Subsequence_Generator_Java

This repository contains a Java program that recursively generates and prints all **subsequences** of a given input string. A subsequence preserves the original order of characters but may skip some of them.

---

## Description

The program uses recursion to explore both possibilities at each character in the input string:
- Include the current character in the subsequence.
- Exclude the current character from the subsequence.
This results in all possible subsequences that preserve the order of characters from the original string.
